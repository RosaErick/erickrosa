## Hi, I'm Erick!

 

:computer: I'm a Web Developement Student from Rio de Janeiro, Brasil!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.

 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects!



## About me

 I'm 26, I graduated from Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro with a degree in History, but have gained a massive interest in web development and technologies. I'm passionate about building things with code. I guess that makes me a Programming Historian or maybe a Multidisciplinary Web Developer.
 Since being introduced to coding I have started reading articles, listening to podcasts, taking online courses and creating a portfolio of projects.
