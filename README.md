## Hi, I'm Erick!



:computer: I'm a Web Developer from Rio de Janeiro, Brasil!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and building with React and Next.js.

 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects!
 
 ðŸŒ± I've worked on some [projects](https://rosaerick.github.io/my-projects/).



## About me

 I graduated from Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro with a degree in History, but have gained a massive interest in software development. I'm passionate about building things with code. I guess that makes me a multidisciplinary Web Developer.
 Since being introduced to coding I have started reading articles, listening to podcasts, taking online courses and creating a portfolio of projects.
